# 🎵 Video to MP3 Microservices System

This is a containerized microservices-based system built with **Python**, **Flask**, **RabbitMQ**, **MongoDB**, **MySQL**, and deployed using **Kubernetes** and **Docker**. It allows authenticated users to upload videos, convert them to MP3 format, and download the results, with optional email notifications upon conversion completion.

---

## 🧰 Technologies

- **Python (Flask)** – for building RESTful APIs
- **RabbitMQ** – message broker for async communication
- **MongoDB + GridFS** – for video and MP3 file storage
- **MySQL** – for storing user credentials
- **JWT** – for secure token-based authentication
- **Kubernetes** – for service orchestration and deployment
- **Docker** – for containerization of services

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The system is composed of several microservices:

### 1. 🔐 Auth Service
- Validates user credentials against a MySQL database.
- Issues JWT tokens on successful login.
- Provides a `/validate` endpoint to decode and verify tokens.

### 2. 📤 Upload Service
- Accepts video uploads from authenticated admin users.
- Stores video files in MongoDB using GridFS.
- Publishes a message to RabbitMQ (`video` queue) for conversion.

### 3. 🔁 Converter Service
- Listens on the `video` queue.
- Retrieves the video from MongoDB.
- Converts the video to MP3 using `moviepy`.
- Stores the converted MP3 in a separate MongoDB collection.
- Publishes a message to the `mp3` queue upon success.

### 4. 📬 Notification Service
- Listens on the `mp3` queue.
- Sends an email notification when conversion is complete.

## 🐳 Docker & Kubernetes

Each service is containerized and communicates via internal networking:

- MongoDB stores raw video files and MP3s using GridFS.
- RabbitMQ is used as the messaging system between services.
- Services use logical DNS names (like `mongodb`, `rabbitmq`) for communication.
- Kubernetes handles service orchestration, scaling, and network configuration.

> It's recommended to expose only necessary ports (5000 for auth, 8080 for gateway).

## 🧪 Example Usage

### 🔑 1. Login and Get JWT

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "yourpassword"}'

---

## 📤 Example Usage

### 1. Login and get JWT:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "yourpassword"}'
```

## Gateway Service
```bash
POST /upload
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
Form: file=<video file>

GET /download?fid=<id>
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```

## Upload video
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/upload \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT>" \
     -F "file=@video.mp4"
```

## Download MP3
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/download?fid=<file_id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT>" --output output.mp3
```

## Check MongoDB

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/check-mongo
```
